# ðŸš— Uber Trip Data Analysis Report

## 1. Introduction: Project Overview and Objectives

This analytical report explores ride fare patterns, pickup/dropoff behavior, and passenger trends based on a dataset of **200,000 Uber rides**.

### Objectives:

- Understand fare distribution and detect anomalies (outliers)
- Identify peak seasons and passenger count behavior
- Offer recommendations for business improvement based on findings

---

## 2. Methodology: Data Collection and Analysis Approach

- **Dataset:** 200,000 records of Uber ride transactions
- **Tools Used:** Python (`pandas`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`), Jupyter Notebook

### Steps Followed:

- Data cleaning: removed null values, invalid coordinates, and negative fares
- Statistical analysis: summary statistics, mean/median/std dev, and outlier detection
- Visual analysis: plotted seasonal and geographical data patterns

---

## 3. Analysis: Detailed Findings and Statistical Insights

### Summary Statistics

**Fare Amount:**

- Mean: `$11.36`
- Median: `$8.50`
- Standard Deviation: `9.89`
- Max: `$499.00`
- Min: `-52.00`
- Outliers Detected: `17,155`

**Passenger Count:**

- Mean: `1.68`
- Standard Deviation: `1.38`
- Max: `208`
- Min: `0`

>  Note: The dataset had extreme outliers, e.g., fares over `$400` and invalid GPS coordinates.

---

### Geographical Patterns:

- Most pickup/dropoff locations are clustered in urban areas (likely NYC).
- Some GPS coordinates were far outside the expected range and flagged as outliers.

---

### Seasonal Trends:

- Clear spike in Uber usage during **Spring** â€” likely due to better weather, tourism, and outdoor activities.

---

## 4. Results: Key Discoveries and Patterns

- Fare distribution is **right-skewed**, with most rides under **$20**.
- Majority of rides had **1 or 2 passengers**.
- Multiple outliers were found in fare amounts and coordinates.
- **Spring** season saw a significant surge in demand.

---

## 5. Conclusion: Summary of Main Findings

- Average Uber fare is approximately **$11.36**.
- Most rides involve **1 passenger** and cost under **$20**.
- **Spring** shows increased Uber usage.
- Data inconsistencies like **negative fares** and **invalid coordinates** were detected and handled.

---

## 6. Recommendations: Data-Driven Business Suggestions

- Implement **fare validation** logic to flag extreme fare values (e.g., over `$200`).
- Apply **stricter coordinate filters** to clean invalid GPS points.
- Launch **marketing campaigns** in Spring to capitalize on high demand.
- Optimize car allocation for **1â€“2 passenger rides**.
- Use **seasonal trends** for demand forecasting and fleet management.
